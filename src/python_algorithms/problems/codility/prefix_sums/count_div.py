CountDiv

Compute number of integers divisible by k in range [a..b].

Write a function:

    def solution(A, B, K)

that, given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within the range [A..B] that are divisible by K, i.e.:

    { i : A <= i <= B, i mod K = 0 }

For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3, because there are three math divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.

Assume that:

        A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];
        K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];
        A <= B.

Complexity:

        expected worst-case time complexity is O(1);
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).

    # just depends whether A is part of the count itself, or not
